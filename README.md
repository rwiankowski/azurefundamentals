## Objectives

The primary goal of this training is to give you a solid understanding of the Azure cloud platform and to prepare you for any further learning. 

## Contents

This training was designed with Microsoft's AZ-900 instructor-led training materials as a baseline. While the official course, which prepares candidates for the Azure Fundamentals exam, is well-rounded and covers most topics needed to become familiar with Azure, I feel compelled to compliment it with some additional sections I subjectively consider valuable.

The training is aligned as much as possible with Microsoft's recommendations but also applies the mission-critical lens to deviate from the standard approach whenever it is more productive. Those deviations will be clearly marked. 

## Format

This material allows you to study how you like, where you want, and at your own pace. I use it to aid the instructor-led and classroom-based training I give regularly, but I also did my best to allow you to follow along on your own. 

## Certification

The secondary goal is to prepare you for the entry-level certification - Azure Fundamentals, which you can obtain by passing the AZ-900 exam. 

Throughout the course, I will provide exam tips highlighting common exam questions and topics, but please bear in mind that Microsoft refreshes and adjusts the questions regularly.

## Acknowledgments and Credits

Throughout this training, I used visual aids created myself, but wherever possible, I also employed images and graphics from the Microsoft official documentation at https://learn.microsoft.com.

Last but not least, the format is not only inspired but copied from [David Beazley's Practical Python](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/) traning. A while ago, I had the pleasure of joining a Python training based on David's content, and I fell in love with the format.
