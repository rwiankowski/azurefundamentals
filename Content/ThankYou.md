# Thank You!

## That's all folks!

If you've read this far - to the very end of this material - I want to thank you for your time and attention.

I hope you have enjoyed learning Azure with me, and I wish you the best of luck in your future cloud-based adventures. 

If you have any feedback or found something lacking or outdated, please be so kind as to [raise a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rwiankowski/azurefundamentals/issues) in the source repository. 

## What now?

If you want to continue preparing for the Azure Fundamentals certification exam and thus desire more learning material, I recommend:
- [The free Microsoft Learn course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/)
-  [John Savill's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/pY0LnKiDwRA?si=q7QtC0_Gcgxk1MgB)

If you want to dive deeper into the more technical aspects of Azure, I will shamelessly plug my own [Azure Technical Training](https://rwiankowski.github.io/azurepractical/)
